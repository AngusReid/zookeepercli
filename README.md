zookeepercli
============

Simple, lightweight, dependable CLI for ZooKeeper

**zookeepercli** is a non-interactive command line client for [ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/). It provides with:

 * Basic CRUD-like operations: `create`, `set`, `delete`, `get`, `ls` (aka `children`).
 * Well formatted and controlled output: supporting either `txt` or `json` format
 * Single, no-dependencies binary file, based on a native Go ZooKeeper library by [github.com/samuel/go-zookeeper](http://github.com/samuel/go-zookeeper)


 
The only existing solution known to the author provides output in uncontrolled, not-well-formed, inconsistent format, and is relatively heavyweight to invoke.
